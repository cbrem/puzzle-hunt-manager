Javascript
- Besides using JavaScript throughout the app, we use objects specifically on
  the backend to make managing the large stored data structure easier
  - ex: HuntData, ClueData, UserData objects in app.js starting line 121

Canvas
- We used a canvas on the teamview page (teamview.html starting line 42) 
  to display a progress map of the users current location in a puzzle hunt
  - see the canvas-ex.png screenshot in the design directory

HTML
- Forms with validation used on every html page
- Tables used on scoreboards (Ex: starting line 85 in adminview.html)

CSS
- CSS reset stylesheet used on every page
- hover styles for buttons (line 104, style.css)
- border-radius
- custom font-face definitions (top of style.css)
- Absolute positioning (ex: line 272, .overlay styles in style.css)

DOM manipulation/jQuery
- Using jQuery to dynamically add clues to interface table in adminview.html
- Binding events to buttons using jQuery all throughout app
- hiding/showing/replacing text using jQuery (ex: all throughout teamview.js)

AJAX client
- Using client to request information to load page contents
  - ex: line 202, loadContents.js
- Using client to submit PUT / POST requests
  - ex: line 46, teamview.js
  - ex: line 125, loadContents.js

AJAX server
- Pretty much the whole point of all of app.js after line 389
