######## Summary ###################

 A management application to help organize puzzle hunts, like
 those of 15-251. Provides ability for event organizers to have
 a central location to manage team progress and clues, and also 
 provides hunt participants with the ability to checkin with
 answers in a central location.

 From the homepage, users can either join an existing event or 
 create a new event. As an administrator, users can add and delete 
 clues for an event. As a participant, users can track their progress
 and submit answers to their current clue, moving them onto the next
 clue if answered correctly.

######## Demo ###################

Search "CMU Hunt".
Start a new team, or login as any of the existing teams by clicking on them.
All passwords are "cmu".
Play through the hunt! (we hope you enjoy it)
(Real hunts would require going around campus and figuring things out)
You can also try editing the hunt (login with password "cmu").
There are adding, editing, and deleting clue features.  Try them out!
If you are feeling inspired, create your own hunt from scratch.
The world is your Puzzle Hunt.
